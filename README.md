# Microprocessor
Based on whatever I learnt in EE2016. Chipun is an 8-bit microprocessor containing the various units of a microprocessor such as Control Unit (CU), Execution Unit (EU), Program Memory (PGM), Data Memory and Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) written in Verilog. It performs MOV (move), STR (store), LOAD, JUMP along with other arithmetic operations.
